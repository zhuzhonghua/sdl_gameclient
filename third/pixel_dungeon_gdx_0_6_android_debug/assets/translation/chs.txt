# Intro
Many heroes of all kinds ventured into the Dungeon before you. Some of them have returned with treasures and magical artifacts, most have never been heard of since. But none have succeeded in retrieving the Amulet of Yendor, which is told to be hidden in the depths of the Dungeon.\n\nYou consider yourself ready for the challenge, but most importantly, you feel that fortune smiles on you. It's time to start your own adventure!
你来这里之前各色英雄曾纷至沓来前往地牢冒险。有些人满载宝藏和魔法物品而归，绝大多数的人则从此杳无音信。但是从来没有一人能取回传闻中藏在地牢极深处的尼德罗护符。\n\n你认为自己已经准备好迎接挑战，但至为重要的是，你感觉幸运正眷顾着你。是时候出发开始属于自己的冒险了！

# Story

The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system. Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, but at least you won't need to deal with evil magic here.
地牢位于城市正下方,较上层的部分实际上构成了城市的下水道系统.作为名义上归属于城市的一部分,这几层并不那么危险.虽然不会有人会把这里称为安全地带,但你在这里起码无需面对邪恶的魔法.

Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts were left locked up here.
许多年前这里兴建了地下牢狱用于囚禁那些最危险的犯人.那个时候这个想法看起来非常明智,因为这里确实很难逃脱.但很快,黑暗的瘴气从下方蔓延而来,让犯人和看守都陷入了疯狂.最终尽管仍然有许多犯人还关押在这里,牢狱还是被废弃了.

The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
废弃牢狱下方延伸出的洞穴人迹罕至.城市难以在这么深的地底进行开发,矿物贫瘠也无法勾起矮人的兴趣.过去这里曾一度是城邦之间驿道的贸易前哨,但自从矮人之都衰落后这里也就荒废了.如今只有那些无处不在的豺狼人和地下生物还在这里游荡.

Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
矮人之都曾是最伟大的矮人城邦.在其全盛时期矮人的机械军团曾成功地抵御古神和它的恶魔军团的入侵.但传闻凯旋的战士也带回了腐朽的种子,这场胜利也标志着这座地下王国衰败的开端.

In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...
过去这里曾是矮人之都的郊区.对抗古神获得代价高昂的胜利后,矮人国度太过虚弱,无法清除这里残留的恶魔.渐渐恶魔占据了这里,如今这里被称作恶魔大厅.\n\n罕有冒险者能抵达这么深处的地底来...
